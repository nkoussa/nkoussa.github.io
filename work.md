### Nussenzweig Lab @ National Cancer Institute
**What I did:**

**Why I joined:** 

**What I learned:**

* Identified targets for synthetic lethal interactions with transposon activation in cancer by mining multi-omic datasets
* Identified mechanisms of resistance to WRN inhibition in cancers with microsatellite instability
* Established protocols for execution and analysis of CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens
* Characterized H-DNA at homopurine/pyrimidine repeats in human cells, leading to a model of H-DNA formation during replication, by integrating S1-END-seq data with meta-analysis of Okazaki fragment and replication timing sequencing, as well as International Cancer Genome Consortium and COSMIC mutation data

### Smith Lab @ New York University
**What I did:**

**Why I joined:** 

**What I learned:**

* Determined the role of limiting concentrations of lagging strand polymerases on Okazaki fragment synthesis
* Created custom scripts and pipelines for integration of sequencing analysis with published datasets
* Optimized a range of techniques, from CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering to novel sequencing-based methods, as well as computational analysis
* Taught a range of classes, from introductory biology to lab-based classes, with excellent evaluations

### Baselga Lab @ Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Massachusetts General Hospital
**What I did:**

**Why I joined:** 

**What I learned:**
* Examined inhibition of DNA repair, particularly homologous recombination, as a radiosensitization strategy in preclinical models of head and neck cancer
* Investigated resistance to PI3K inhibitors, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and estrogen receptor inhibitors leading to high impact publications
* Independently managed all aspects related to day-to-day functioning of a highly productive lab, including equipment, supplies, reagents, animals, and licenses, as well as mentoring and supervising multiple junior technicians.
* Established the first patient-derived xenograft program at MSKCC for breast and head & neck cancer
* Seamlessly transitioned the laboratory from Boston to New York in less than a week
