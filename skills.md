### Computational
* Unix environment & high-performance computing (HPC) clusters
* R and Python
* Common bioinformatic toolkits and packages
* Analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data, including custom sequencing methods
* Analysis of RNA-seq/transcriptomics and integration with other large-scale datasets (e.g. proteomics)
* Analysis of CRISPR screens 
* Integration of published datasets (nucleosome positioning, transcription factor positioning, replication origins, replication timing, DepMap) into custom analyses
* Variant calling and integration of cancer mutation datasets (ICGC, COSMIC, etc) into custom analyses
* Statistical analysis 

### Wet-lab
* Next-Generation Sequencing preparation, including custom sequencing methods (OF-seq, HydEN-seq, END-seq)
* CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens
* Primary and immortal cell culture (proliferation assays, transfection, transduction, CRISPR/Cas9)
* Standard molecular biology techniques (DNA/RNA extraction, PCR, cloning, qRT-PCR, etc)
* Viral vector cloning and delivery (lentivirus, retrovirus, adeno-associated virus)
* Western & Southern blotting, immunoprecipitation
* Flow cytometry and analysis, including multi-color
* Immunofluorescence, comet assays, and microscopy
* Radioactive work (32P, 35S, cesium source)
* Mouse work, including breeding, xenograft transplantation, irradiation, treating (oral gavage, IP, tail vein)
* Yeast work, including genetic engineering (standard methods, CRISPR-Cas9, crossing)
